### Notes
- This project was my first real attempt at building something meaningful from the ground up. It represents my journey of turning an idea into a fully functional application. I’m incredibly proud of how it came together, as it taught me so much about designing, developing, and deploying software. While it may not be perfect and could have small issues, it’s a project that truly reflects my growth and passion for software development.
